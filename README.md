# Mini-Pitch
Mini-Pitch is an online platform created to allow students to post their stock pitches in order to develop their financial literacy and elevate their interest in this industry. We utilise a range of financial models (DCF, Trading Comps Valuation and CAPM) to help to increase the reliability of our research.
